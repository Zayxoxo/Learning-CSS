**RESPONSIVE WEBPAGES USING HTML AND CSS WITH A TOUCH OF JAVASCRIPT**

**CSS Assignments(ALT-SCHL)**
This repository showcases my work for four different assignments built as part of my journey to becoming a front-end developer. I built the assignments using strictly HTML and CSS, with a touch of JavaScript and animation for added interactivity on the homepage.

**Project Overview**
The goal of this project was to display four separate assignments, each of which is accessible via a tab-based navigation system. The homepage is designed to display the assignments in a neat, interactive layout, and you can click on each assignment tab to view its respective details.

**Features**
Tab Navigation: The assignments are laid out in tabs, and each tab redirects to its respective assignment page when clicked.
HTML & CSS Layouts: All assignments are built using fundamental front-end technologies, focusing on layout and design principles.
JavaScript & Animation: For a smoother user experience, I used a bit of JavaScript and animation to switch between the assignments dynamically on the homepage.

**Technologies Used**
HTML: For creating the structure of the pages.
CSS: For styling and layout. I used Flexbox, Grid, and custom properties to ensure responsive design.
JavaScript: A small amount of JavaScript was used to switch between tabs dynamically on the homepage.
Animation: Basic animations were applied to enhance the user interface.
